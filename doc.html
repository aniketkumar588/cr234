<h1> THE BIGGEST SCAM OF 1992 </h1>
	<p> The 1992 Indian stock market scam was a market manipulation carried out by Harshad Shantilal Mehta
	 with other bankers and politicians on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scam caused significant disruption 
	 to the stock market of India, defrauding investors of over ten million USD.
	</p>
<p> Techniques used by Mehta involved having corrupt officials signing fake cheques, misusing market loopholes, 
and fabrication to drive the prices of stocks up to 40 times their original price. Stock traders making good
 returns as a result of the scam were able to fraudulently obtain unsecured loans from banks. When the scam 
 was discovered in April 1992, the Indian stock market collapsed, and the same banks
	</p>
	<br>
	<p> the scam was the biggest money market scam ever committed in India, amounting to approximately ₹ 5,000 crores. The main perpetrator of the scam was a stock and money market broker Harshad Mehta. It was a systematic stock scam using bank receipts and stamp paper that caused the Indian stock market to crash. The scam exposed the inherent loopholes of the Indian financial systems and resulted in a completely reformed system of stock transactions, including an introduction of online security systems.[1]

Security frauds refer to the idea of diversion of funds from the banking system to various stockholders or brokers.[2] The 1992 scam was a systematic fraud committed by Mehta in the Indian stock market which led to the complete collapse of security systems. He committed a scam of over 1  billion from the banking system to buy stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange.[3] This impacted the entire exchange system as the security system collapsed and investors lost hundreds of thousands of rupees in the exchange system. The scope of the scam was so large that the net value of the stocks was higher than the combined health and education budget of India. The scam was orchestrated in such a way that Mehta secured securities from the State Bank of India against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities. Mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and sold the stocks that he owned in these companies.[4] The impact of the scam had many consequences, which included the losses incurred by lakhs of families and the immediate crash of the stock market. The index fell from 4500 to 2500 representing a loss of ₹ 1000  billion in market capitalization.[2] The 1992 scam raised many questions involving bank officials responsible for being in collusion with Mehta. An interview with Montek Singh Ahluwalia (Secretary, economic affairs at the Ministry of Finance) revealed that many top bank officials were involved.
